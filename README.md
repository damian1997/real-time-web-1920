# Description
This application tries to bring people together online to listen to their favorite music genre's.

# Concept
The application is build with the use of sockets, this enables us to create the possibility of communication between users in real time.
Sockets are used to create rooms which people can join and listen to the same music together. The rooms are created with a Spotify playlist
linked to the room so the users in the same room have the same music in front of them. From this playlist the users can add songs to their
playback queue and others get notified that a song is added to the queue .

# Data life cycle
This project does not make use of a database and all the information is stored on the server.

# Source of truth
In this application the server is the only source of truth, everything is stored on the server and only from the server
decisions are being made. Because everything resides on the server the data is persistent and every user has the correct data
and is not 1 step behind the rest.

# Real time events
* Join room:

When a person enters the room others will get a updated list of users.

* Disconnect:

When a person leaves the room others will get a updated list of users.

* Add to queue:

When someone adds a song the the playback the  queue overview will be updated.

* Remove song from queue:

When the currently played song is the same as the first song in the queue the queue will be updated and posted to everyone.
