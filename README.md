# Description
This application tries to bring people together online to listen to their favorite music genre's.

# Concept
The application is build with the use of sockets, this enables us to create the possibility of communication between users in real time.
Sockets are used to create rooms which people can join and listen to the same music together. The rooms are created with a Spotify playlist
linked to the room so the users in the same room have the same music in front of them. From this playlist the users can add songs to their
playback que and others get notified that a song is added to the que.

# Source of truth
In this application the server is the only source of truth, everything is stored on the server and only from the server
decisions are being made. Because everything resides on the server the data is persistent and every user has the correct data
and is not 1 step behind the rest.

# Real time events
* Join room
When a person enters the room others will get a updated list of users.

* Disconnect
When a person leaves the room others will get a updated list of users.

* Add to que
When someone adds a song the the playback the que overview will be updated.

* Remove song from que
When the currently played song is the same as the first song in the que the que will be updated and posted to everyone.
