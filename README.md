# Description
This application tries to bring people together online to listen to their favorite music genre's.

# Concept
The application is build with the use of sockets, this enables us to create the possibility of communication between users in real time.
Sockets are used to create rooms which people can join and listen to the same music together. The rooms are created with a Spotify playlist
linked to the room so the users in the same room have the same music in front of them. From this playlist the users can add songs to their
playback que and others get notified that a song is added to the que.
